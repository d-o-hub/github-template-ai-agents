# Install post-commit hook (for docs sync)
# 
# HOOK TEMPLATE GENERATION PATTERN:
# We use a here-document (<< 'HOOK') to embed the hook script content.
# The delimiter 'HOOK' (quoted) prevents variable expansion at install time,
# which is critical because the hook must use $REPO_ROOT at runtime, not install time.
#
# SUBSTITUTION STRATEGY:
#   - $REPO_ROOT is written as $REPO_ROOT (literal) in the template
#   - It will be resolved by git rev-parse --show-toplevel at hook runtime
#   - This makes the hook portable across different clone locations
#
# WHY post-commit?
#   This hook runs after a commit is created but before it's pushed.
#   We use it to auto-update derived documentation (AGENTS.md, AGENTS_REGISTRY.md)
#   when the source files (.agents/skills/*) change.
#
# THE amend --no-edit PATTERN:
#   After updating docs, we amend the commit to include the changes.
#   --no-edit preserves the original commit message.
#   This doesn't trigger an infinite loop because git hooks don't run on amend.

#
# PRE-COMMIT HOOK DESIGN:
#   This hook blocks commits that fail quality checks.
#   It's the "gatekeeper" that enforces code quality before code enters history.
#
# WHY set -e?
#   The hook must exit with error on any failure to block the commit.
#   This is different from install-hooks.sh which uses -e for general safety.
#
# VALIDATION ORDER:
#   1. Git hooks config (prevents global hooks from interfering)
#   2. Quality gate (runs all language-specific checks)
#   If any step fails, the commit is aborted with a helpful message.
