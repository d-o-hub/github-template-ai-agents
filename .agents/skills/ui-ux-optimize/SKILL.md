# UI/UX Prompt Optimizer

Swarm-powered skill for generating implementation-ready UI/UX prompts. Uses a **swarm of 7 specialized agents** with handoff coordination, an **autoresearch loop** (try → score → keep/revert → repeat), and **backpressure quality gates** to converge on high-quality output.

## When to Use

- UI/UX design help, redesign, or critique for any digital product
- Prompt optimization for a design or coding agent
- A structured design brief from a vague idea
- A design audit of an existing interface
- Variant generation for a design system or component

Supported: web apps, mobile apps, dashboards, admin tools, e-commerce, SaaS, web/mobile games, kiosk/touch UIs, internal tools, prototypes.

## When NOT to Use

- Pure branding (logos, print, identity only)
- Motion graphics or video production
- Backend architecture with no UI component
- Marketing copy without interface context
- Already implementation-ready requests

## Swarm Architecture

7 specialized agents with handoff coordination. Full details → `references/swarm-coordination.md`

```
RESEARCH SCOUT → TOKEN ARCHITECT → LAYOUT ENGINEER → VARIANT GENERATOR → BROWSER VERIFIER → QUALITY AUDITOR
                                    └── ANTI-SLOP SENTINEL (cross-cutting) ──┘
```

| Agent | Domain |
|---|---|
| Research Scout | Domain trends, platform guidelines, competitor analysis |
| Token Architect | Semantic design tokens, typography, color, spacing |
| Layout Engineer | Navigation, screen hierarchy, responsive composition |
| Variant Generator | 3 design variants with shared tokens + override diffs |
| Browser Verifier | Playwright screenshots, overlap detection, tap targets |
| Quality Auditor | Review checklist scoring, confidence, lessons |
| Anti-Slop Sentinel | Cross-cutting: translates vague language, detects AI patterns |

## Autoresearch Loop

Inspired by pi-autoresearch: try → measure → keep/revert → repeat until score stabilizes.

1. Run full swarm pipeline
2. Quality Auditor scores with confidence (MAD-based)
   - Game products: 0–66 (all 10 sections), threshold 60
   - Non-game products: 0–57 (9 sections, game-specific N/A), threshold 52
   - Use **effective percentage** (score/max_applicable) for keep decision
3. Effective ≥ 91% AND confidence ≥ 2.0× → **KEEP**
4. Effective < 91% OR confidence < 1.0× → **REVISE** (re-run weak agent downstream)
5. Score regresses → **REVERT** (discard, try different approach)
6. Max 5 iterations per session

Full details → `references/swarm-coordination.md`

## Session Files

Two files persist across runs (matching pi-autoresearch pattern):
- `ui-ux-session.md` — living document: objective, what's been tried, key wins, dead ends
- `ui-ux-session.jsonl` — append-only log: one JSON line per iteration

## Gotchas

These failure modes recur across sessions. Keep as quick-reference.

- **AI Slop gravity:** Agents default to Inter, purple gradients, three-column feature grids. Override explicitly with opinionated font choices and precedent products.
- **Mobile horizontal overflow:** Horizontal nav/lists break on mobile <768px. Always enforce `overflow-x-auto` for horizontal navigation, `overflow-x-hidden` on root container.
- **Z-Index wars:** Absolute positioning for core layout causes overlapping elements. Enforce flow-based layouts (Flexbox/Grid). Absolute only for HUDs/overlays with defined safe zones.
- **Flickering transitions:** State transitions without presence guards flicker. Use `AnimatePresence` with `mode="wait"` and `initial={false}`. High-motion elements need `will-change-transform transform-gpu backface-visibility-hidden`.
- **Scrollbar jitter:** Unstable scrollbars cause layout shifts between viewports. Enforce `overflow-x-hidden` on root, `overflow-y-auto` for content containers.
- **Nested scroll contexts:** `min-h-screen` in sub-components inside scrollable parents creates double scrollbars. Use `min-h-full` for sub-components.

## Required Workflow

Run every step. Swarm coordinates handoffs.

### Phase 1: Research & Translate

**Step 0 — Research Scout: Auto-Research.** Research domain trends, platform guidelines, competitor patterns via `websearch`. Handoff → `research_context`. See → `references/auto-research.md`

**Step 1 — Anti-Slop Sentinel: Translate.** Convert vague words to measurable constraints. Cross-ref `anti-ai-slop` skill. Handoff → `anti_slop_warnings`. See → `references/anti-slop-rules.md`

### Phase 2: Token & Structure

**Step 2 — Token Architect: Build Tokens.** Semantic token system from research + translated language. Handoff → `design_tokens`. See → `references/design-tokens.md`

**Step 3 — Layout Engineer: Navigation & Composition.** Nav model, screen map, responsive spec. See → `references/navigation-clarity.md`, `references/layout-composition.md`

**Step 3a — Game Layer** *(skip if not game).* HUD, menus, safe zones. See → `references/game-ui-rules.md`

### Phase 3: Generate & Verify

**Step 4 — Coordinator: Assemble Prompt.** See → `templates/optimize-prompt-template.md`

**Step 5 — Variant Generator: 3 Variants.** Default: editorial/product/expressive. Game: immersive/competitive/minimal-hud. See → `references/variant-worktree-flow.md`

**Step 6 — Layout Engineer: Safety Audit.** Overlap, wrapping, truncation at all breakpoints. Fill `templates/design-audit-template.md`.

**Step 6a — Token Validation (pre-check).** Run `node .agents/skills/ui-ux-optimize/scripts/validate-tokens.cjs` to fast-fail if design docs or TOKENS export are missing. Fix before browser verification.

**Step 6b — Browser Verifier: Screenshots** *(when HTML available).* Playwright at 375/768/1024/1440px. If no HTML prototype exists, **SKIP** with a `browser_verification.status: "SKIPPED"` note describing what would be verified. See → `references/browser-verification.md`

### Phase 4: Audit & Learn

**Step 7 — Anti-Slop Sentinel: Final Audit.** No banned words remain.

**Step 8 — Quality Auditor: Score & Gate.** Score against checklist (0–66). See → `references/review-checklist.md`

**Step 9 — Quality Auditor: Record Lessons.** Append to session files. See → `references/self-learning-loop.md`
