# Lessons Learned

Catalog of technical discoveries, debugging resolutions, and process improvements for the AI agent template.

## Format

Each lesson follows a dual-write pattern for both human readability and agent discovery:

1. **Verbose Entry (this file)**: Detailed debugging log and onboarding resource.
   - Sequential numbering (LESSON-001, LESSON-002, etc.)
   - Date and component tags
   - Issue/Symptoms/Root Cause/Solution/Prevention structure
2. **Distilled Insight (nearest AGENTS.md)**: 1–3 line note for runtime agent loading.
   - Placed in the `AGENTS.md` file closest to the affected code (e.g., `scripts/AGENTS.md`).
   - Focuses on the non-obvious core finding.

For machine-readable index, see `lessons.jsonl`.

### LESSON-001: Bash Exit Code 2 - Misuse of Shell Builtins in CI

**Date**: 2026-04-01
**Component**: CI/CD / Bash Scripts / Quality Gate
**Severity**: High

**Issue**: Quality Gate CI job fails with exit code 2 in GitHub Actions while passing locally.

**Symptoms**:
- `Process completed with exit code 2` in CI only
- Same script passes on developer machines
- Validate Skills job passes, Quality Gate fails
- No visible error output before exit

**Root Cause**:
1. **Exit Code 2 Meaning**: "Misuse of shell builtins" per Bash documentation - indicates empty function definitions, missing keywords, permission problems, or builtin misuse
2. **`set -e` is unreliable**: Has "extremely convoluted and version-dependent behavior" per BashFAQ/105
3. **Functions behave differently**: `set -e` is effectively ignored inside functions called in conditionals
4. **`realpath --relative-to` is GNU-specific**: Not available in minimal CI containers (Alpine, etc.)
5. **TTY/Color Detection**: `test -t 1` returns true locally, false in non-TTY CI

**Solution**:
```bash
# Don't use set -e - it's unreliable in CI
set -uo pipefail

# Use readlink -f for portability instead of realpath --relative-to
target=$(readlink -f "$link" 2>/dev/null || echo "")

# Safe color detection
if [[ -t 1 ]] && [[ "${FORCE_COLOR:-}" != "0" ]]; then
    RED='\033[0;31m'
else
    RED=''
fi

# Track failures explicitly
EXIT_CODE=0
run_check() { ... ; EXIT_CODE=1; }
exit $EXIT_CODE
```

**Prevention**:
- Test scripts in non-TTY mode: `bash script.sh | cat`
- Avoid GNU-specific options like `realpath --relative-to`
- Never rely on `set -e` for CI scripts
- Use explicit error tracking with EXIT_CODE variables
- Document CI-specific behavior in skill references

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/validate-skills.sh` - Fixed set -e and realpath issues
- `scripts/quality_gate.sh` - Fixed set -e and color handling
- `.github/workflows/ci-and-labels.yml` - Added debug output

### LESSON-002: AGENTS.md Line Limit Violation - Progressive Disclosure Principle

**Date**: 2026-04-02
**Component**: Documentation / Architecture / AGENTS.md
**Severity**: Medium

**Issue**: AGENTS.md grew to 278 lines, exceeding the 150-line target for progressive disclosure.

**Symptoms**:
- Document contains detailed workflow explanations
- Language-specific code examples duplicated from skills
- Extensive troubleshooting sections inline
- Hard to scan for essential information

**Root Cause**:
1. **Scope creep**: Added detailed content instead of references
2. **No enforcement**: Line limit documented but not checked automatically
3. **Duplication**: Content existed in both AGENTS.md and skills

**Solution**:
1. **Line Count Reduction** (278 → 146 lines):
   - Moved detailed workflows → `agents-docs/HARNESS.md`
   - Moved language examples → skill `references/` folders
   - Moved troubleshooting → individual skill docs
   - Kept in AGENTS.md: constants, overview, setup, quality gate commands, style rules, security warnings, agent guidance principles, skills table, reference links

2. **Created specialized skills**:
   - `agents-md` skill (96 lines): AGENTS.md creation guidance
   - `code-quality` skill (124 lines): Code patterns and linting tools
   - `test-runner` skill (160 lines): Framework commands and testing strategy

3. **Reference naming standardization**:
   - Standardized on `references/` (plural) across all skills
   - Migrated 13 skills from `references/` → `references/`

4. **Centralized configuration**:
   - Created `.agents/config.sh` with named constants and utility functions
   - Single source of truth for MAX_LINES_PER_SOURCE_FILE, etc.

**Prevention**:
- Add validation in `validate-skills.sh` to check AGENTS.md line count
- Document the "250-line rule" prominently in skill creation docs
- Use `@agents-docs/` references instead of inline content
- Review AGENTS.md size during PR review

**Files Modified**:
- `AGENTS.md` - Reduced from 278 to 146 lines
- `.agents/skills/agents-md/SKILL.md` - Created
- `.agents/skills/code-quality/SKILL.md` - Created
- `.agents/skills/test-runner/SKILL.md` - Created
- `.agents/config.sh` - Created with centralized constants
- 13 skills migrated: `references/` → `references/`

### LESSON-003: Skill Malformed JSON - Invalid evals.json Syntax

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: Skills / Evaluations / skill-creator
**Severity**: Critical

**Issue**: `skill-creator/evals/evals.json` contains malformed JSON that breaks skill evaluation.

**Symptoms**:
- Eval ID 4 missing closing brace before ID 5
- JSON parser fails on skill evaluation
- Silent failures in skill testing
- Other skills may have similar issues

**Root Cause**:
1. **No JSON Schema validation**: `skill-rules.json` and `evals.json` lack schema enforcement
2. **Manual editing**: JSON files edited without validation
3. **No CI check**: Quality gate doesn't validate JSON structure

**Solution**:
1. **Immediate fix**: Add missing closing brace in skill-creator evals.json
2. **Schema validation**: Create JSON Schema for `evals.json` and `skill-rules.json`
3. **CI enforcement**: Add validation step to quality gate
4. **Automated checking**: Add pre-commit hook for JSON validation

**Prevention**:
- Never edit evals.json manually without validation
- Use `jq` to validate JSON before committing: `cat evals.json | jq empty`
- Add JSON Schema validation in `validate-skills.sh`
- CI check for all skill metadata files

**Files Modified**:
- `.agents/skills/skill-creator/evals/evals.json` - Fixed JSON syntax
- Schema validation to be added to quality gate

---

### LESSON-004: Atomic Commit Workflow Zero Test Coverage

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: Testing / atomic-commit / Scripts
**Severity**: Critical

**Issue**: The entire atomic commit workflow (2,835 lines across 8 scripts) has ZERO test coverage.

**Symptoms**:
- 8 scripts in `scripts/atomic-commit/` completely untested
- Rollback mechanisms not validated
- GitHub CLI integration (`gh` commands) not mocked
- Retry logic with exponential backoff untested
- Polling mechanisms not validated
- Secret detection patterns not tested against sample data

**Root Cause**:
1. **Complex mocking required**: `gh` and `git` commands need sophisticated mocks
2. **Integration complexity**: Multi-phase workflow hard to test in isolation
3. **No test framework setup**: BATS not fully integrated in CI
4. **CI disables tests**: `SKIP_TESTS=true` in workflow

**Solution**:
1. **Create BATS test suite** for all atomic-commit scripts
2. **Mock infrastructure**: Create mock `gh` and `git` commands for testing
3. **Phase-based testing**: Test each phase independently
4. **Integration tests**: Full workflow with temporary git repositories
5. **Enable tests in CI**: Remove `SKIP_TESTS=true`

**Prevention**:
- Every script >50 lines must have tests
- Mock external dependencies (gh, git, API calls)
- Property-based testing for validation logic
- Test coverage reporting with kcov/bashcov

**Files to Test**:
- `scripts/atomic-commit/run.sh` (285 lines)
- `scripts/atomic-commit/atomic-commit.sh` (569 lines)
- `scripts/atomic-commit/pre-commit-check.sh` (439 lines)
- `scripts/atomic-commit/create-pr.sh` (556 lines)
- `scripts/atomic-commit/sync-and-push.sh` (523 lines)
- `scripts/atomic-commit/verify-checks.sh` (463 lines)

### LESSON-005: GitHub Actions SKIP_TESTS - Tests Disabled in CI

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: CI/CD / Testing / GitHub Actions
**Severity**: Critical

**Issue**: CI workflow explicitly disables all testing with `SKIP_TESTS=true`.

**Symptoms**:
- Quality gate runs but skips test execution
- BATS framework not installed or executed
- Python tests skipped conditionally
- No test result reporting (JUnit/SARIF)
- Code changes not validated

**Root Cause**:
1. **Historical workaround**: Tests were failing so they were disabled
2. **No test infrastructure**: BATS not properly set up in CI
3. **Fear of blocking**: Tests might fail so CI skips them

**Solution**:
1. **Remove `SKIP_TESTS=true`** from `.github/workflows/ci-and-labels.yml`
2. **Install BATS in CI**: Add setup step for test framework
3. **Run all tests**: BATS and Python tests must pass
4. **Add coverage reporting**: Track coverage over time
5. **Fix failing tests**: Address pre-existing test failures

**Prevention**:
- Tests must pass for PR merge
- Pre-commit hooks run tests locally
- CI tests identical to local tests
- Coverage gates in CI (e.g., must maintain 80% coverage)

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/ci-and-labels.yml` - Remove SKIP_TESTS, add test execution

---

### LESSON-006: Skill Evaluation Gaps - Insufficient Edge Case Coverage

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: Skills / Evaluations / Coverage
**Severity**: High

**Issue**: 80% of skills (24 of 30) lack comprehensive edge case evaluations.

**Symptoms**:
- Skills with <5 evals (6 skills, 20%)
- No error handling evals (18 skills, 60%)
- No integration scenarios between skills
- Subjective assertions in evals ("feels natural", "can understand")
- No negative test cases (failure paths)

**Root Cause**:
1. **Focus on happy path**: Evals only test success scenarios
2. **No eval guidance**: SKILLS.md lacks evaluation authoring guide
3. **No quality gate**: CI doesn't validate eval coverage
4. **Manual process**: No automation for eval structure

**Solution**:
1. **Add edge case evals** to all skills:
   - parallel-execution: threshold synchronization, failure handling
   - goap-agent: dynamic replanning (only 4 evals currently)
   - testing-strategy: mutation testing (mentioned but not tested)
   - security-code-auditor: Go/Rust/Java-specific tests

2. **Standardize eval format**:
   - Remove subjective assertions
   - Add version field to all evals.json
   - Include negative test cases

3. **Create evals documentation**:
   - Add section to `agents-docs/SKILLS.md`
   - Document how to write comprehensive evals

**Prevention**:
- Minimum 5 evals per skill (goap-agent currently fails this)
- At least 1 negative test case per skill
- JSON Schema validation for evals.json
- No subjective assertions (replace with checkable patterns)

**Priority Skills to Fix**:
- skill-creator: Fix malformed JSON, add line limit eval
- parallel-execution: Add threshold sync eval
- testing-strategy: Add mutation testing eval
- security-code-auditor: Add language-specific evals

### LESSON-007: Atomic Commit Missing Timeout - Network Operation Hangs

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: atomic-commit / Git Operations / Timeout
**Severity**: High

**Issue**: Git push retry loop in atomic commit workflow has no timeout; can hang indefinitely.

**Symptoms**:
- CI jobs hang forever on network issues
- No visibility into which operation is stuck
- Resources consumed indefinitely
- Pipeline blocking

**Root Cause**:
1. **No timeout wrapper**: `git push` commands lack timeout
2. **Infinite retry**: Retry loop has no maximum duration
3. **No progress indication**: Hanging operations are silent

**Solution**:
```bash
# Add timeout to all external commands
MAX_OPERATION_SECONDS=300

timeout $MAX_OPERATION_SECONDS git push origin "$branch" || {
    echo "ERROR: Push timed out after ${MAX_OPERATION_SECONDS}s"
    EXIT_CODE=1
}

# Or implement watchdog timer
```

**Prevention**:
- Wrap all network operations with timeout
- Implement exponential backoff with maximum total time
- Add progress logging for long operations
- CI timeout should be shorter than GitHub Actions timeout

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/atomic-commit/sync-and-push.sh` - Add timeout to git operations

### LESSON-008: Agent Override Inconsistency - CLAUDE.md vs GEMINI.md

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: Documentation / Agent Overrides / CLAUDE.md
**Severity**: Medium

**Issue**: Agent-specific override files have inconsistent content depth and purpose.

**Symptoms**:
- `CLAUDE.md` has substantial content (46 lines)
- `GEMINI.md` is only `@AGENTS.md` (1 line)
- `QWEN.md` is minimal
- Override pattern is unclear
- Content duplication risk

**Root Cause**:
1. **No clear policy**: What can be overridden vs. what must stay in AGENTS.md
2. **Ad hoc additions**: Overrides added without schema
3. **No validation**: No check that overrides follow pattern

**Solution**:
1. **Define override schema** in `agents-docs/AGENT_OVERRIDES.md`:
   - Allowed: CLI-specific settings, tool preferences, timeout overrides
   - Forbidden: Duplicating AGENTS.md content, changing procedures

2. **Standardize minimal pattern**:
   ```markdown
   @AGENTS.md
   
   # Claude-Specific Settings
   - Max output tokens: 8192
   - Preferred diff format: unified
   ```

3. **Add validation**: Check that agent files only contain overrides

**Prevention**:
- Document override hierarchy
- Validate agent-specific files in CI
- Never duplicate AGENTS.md content
- Keep overrides minimal (<20 lines)

**Files Modified**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Remove shared content, keep only overrides
- `GEMINI.md` - Already correct pattern
- `agents-docs/AGENT_OVERRIDES.md` - Create documentation

---

### LESSON-009: Documentation Sync Duplication - Frontmatter Parsing Logic

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: Scripts / Documentation / DRY Principle
**Severity**: Medium

**Issue**: `update-agents-md.sh` and `update-agents-registry.sh` implement similar frontmatter parsing logic independently.

**Symptoms**:
- Code duplication between two scripts
- Same regex patterns in multiple places
- Violates DRY principle
- Maintenance burden (fix in 2+ places)

**Root Cause**:
1. **Scripts evolved separately**: No shared library concept
2. **Copy-paste development**: Similar functionality added independently
3. **No abstraction**: Missing shared utility layer

**Solution**:
1. **Create shared library** `scripts/lib/docs-utils.sh`:
   ```bash
   extract_frontmatter_field() { ... }
   generate_markdown_table() { ... }
   update_section_in_file() { ... }
   ```

2. **Refactor scripts** to use library:
   ```bash
   source "$(dirname "$0")/../scripts/lib/docs-utils.sh"
   ```

3. **Add tests** for library functions

**Prevention**:
- Check for duplication during PR review
- Create `scripts/lib/` for shared utilities
- Document library usage in AGENTS.md
- Add ShellCheck for library imports

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/lib/docs-utils.sh` - Create shared library
- `scripts/update-agents-md.sh` - Refactor to use library
- `scripts/update-agents-registry.sh` - Refactor to use library

### LESSON-010: Git Worktree Cleanup and Registration

**Date**: 2026-04-05
**Component**: Scripts / Worktree Management
**Severity**: Medium

**Issue**: Scripts creating git worktrees leave orphaned directories and administrative data if they crash or are interrupted.

**Symptoms**:
- `git worktree list` shows many unused worktrees
- `fatal: '...' already exists` when running scripts multiple times
- Disk space consumption on long-running development machines

**Root Cause**:
1. **Missing Cleanup Traps**: Scripts didn't use `trap` to ensure cleanup on exit/error
2. **No Central Registration**: No shared array to track created worktrees for bulk cleanup

**Solution**:
```bash
# Register worktrees in a shared array
CREATED_WORKTREES=()
cleanup() {
    for wt in "${CREATED_WORKTREES[@]}"; do
        git worktree remove --force "$wt" 2>/dev/null || true
    done
}
trap cleanup EXIT ERR

# Add to registry when created
git worktree add "$path" "$branch"
CREATED_WORKTREES+=("$path")
```

**Prevention**:
- Use `scripts/lib/worktree-manager.sh` for all worktree operations
- Always register created worktrees in `CREATED_WORKTREES`
- Use the `trap cleanup EXIT ERR` pattern in all stateful scripts

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/lib/worktree-manager.sh` - Implemented registration and cleanup logic
- `scripts/swarm-worktree-web-research.sh` - Updated to use manager

---

### LESSON-011: CI Reliability - Why Validation Scripts Need `set +e`

**Date**: 2026-04-05
**Component**: CI/CD / Bash Scripts / Quality Gate
**Severity**: Medium

**Issue**: Validation scripts (like `validate-skills.sh`) exit prematurely on the first minor failure, preventing a full report of all issues.

**Symptoms**:
- CI job stops after the first failing skill check
- Developers have to fix one error at a time (whack-a-mole)
- Incomplete validation state in CI logs

**Root Cause**:
1. **Global `set -e`**: Scripts used `set -e` which causes immediate exit on any non-zero return code
2. **Incompatible with Error Accumulation**: Manual error tracking (e.g., `FAILED=1`) is bypassed by `set -e` if a command fails inside a loop

**Solution**:
```bash
# Explicitly disable errexit to allow manual error tracking
set +e
set -uo pipefail

FAILED=0
# ... run checks ...
[[ $something_failed ]] && FAILED=1

# Exit with accumulated status at the end
exit $((FAILED))
```

**Prevention**:
- Use `set +e` in scripts designed to accumulate multiple errors
- Document why `set +e` is used to prevent well-intentioned "fixes" back to `set -e`
- Use explicit `exit` codes based on accumulated `FAILED` variables

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/validate-skills.sh` - Changed to `set +e` with error tracking
- `scripts/validate-skill-format.sh` - Changed to `set +e`

---

### LESSON-012: Bash Variable Scope - The `temp_table` Issue

**Date**: 2026-04-05
**Component**: Scripts / Bash / Variable Shadowing
**Severity**: Low

**Issue**: Using generic variable names like `temp_table` in scripts causes collisions and unexpected behavior when scripts are sourced or have complex trap logic.

**Symptoms**:
- Temporary files not being cleaned up
- `trap` removing files still in use by other parts of the script
- Data corruption in temporary markdown tables

**Root Cause**:
1. **Global Scope by Default**: Bash variables are global unless declared `local` in a function
2. **Naming Collisions**: Multiple functions or sourced scripts using the same `temp_table` name
3. **Trap Execution Context**: Traps run in the global scope and may see modified or unset variables

**Solution**:
```bash
# Define unique, descriptive names for temporary files
# Use REPO_ROOT and script-specific prefixes
readonly UPDATE_MD_TEMP_TABLE="$REPO_ROOT/.update_md_temp.md"

# Declare before trap to ensure availability
trap 'rm -f "$UPDATE_MD_TEMP_TABLE"' EXIT
```

**Prevention**:
- Use unique prefixes for temporary variables and files
- Use `readonly` where possible for configuration variables
- Define all variables used in `trap` BEFORE the trap is set

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/update-agents-md.sh` - Refactored `temp_table` usage

### LESSON-013: CI Hangs Indefinitely Due to BATS Recursion

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: CI/CD / BATS Testing / Quality Gate
**Severity**: Critical

**Issue**: Quality Gate job in GitHub Actions hangs for 15+ minutes, never completes, eventually times out after 6 hours.

**Symptoms**:
- Job shows "Run quality gate" step in progress indefinitely
- No output after "Running Shell script checks..."
- Local execution completes in ~60 seconds
- Multiple workflow retries exhibit same behavior

**Root Cause**:
1. **BATS Version Incompatibility**: Ubuntu apt-get installs BATS 1.2.1 (2021), tests use `setup_file()` (requires 1.5+ from 2022)
2. **Infinite Recursion**: `quality_gate.sh` calls `bats tests/` → tests call `quality_gate.sh` → loops forever
3. **Missing Job Timeout**: No `timeout-minutes` specified, defaults to 6 hours
4. **No Recursion Guard**: Script has no mechanism to detect it's already running inside BATS

**Solution**:
```bash
# In quality_gate.sh - add recursion guard
if [ -d "tests" ] && [ "${SKIP_TESTS:-false}" != "true" ] && [ -z "${BATS_TEST_FILENAME:-}" ]; then
    # Only run BATS if not already inside a BATS test
    bats tests/
fi
```

```yaml
# In workflow - skip BATS in CI and add timeout
quality-gate:
  timeout-minutes: 10
  steps:
    - run: SKIP_TESTS=true ./scripts/quality_gate.sh
```

**Prevention**:
- Always set `timeout-minutes` on CI jobs (fail fast vs 6 hour hang)
- Check for `BATS_TEST_FILENAME` env var before invoking BATS
- Never call parent script from test files without guards
- Use `npm install -g bats` instead of apt-get for current version

**Tags**: #bats #recursion #ci-hang #timeout #testing

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/ci-and-labels.yml` - Add timeout, skip BATS
- `scripts/quality_gate.sh` - Add BATS_TEST_FILENAME check

---

### LESSON-014: Shellcheck Warnings vs Errors in CI

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: CI/CD / Shellcheck / Code Quality
**Severity**: Medium

**Issue**: Shellcheck fails CI build on style warnings (SC2155, SC2034), blocking merges for non-functional issues.

**Symptoms**:
- Shellcheck reports "Declare and assign separately" warnings
- Unused variable warnings (SC2034)
- CI fails even though scripts execute correctly
- 31+ warnings on large scripts like `github-workflow/run.sh`

**Root Cause**:
1. **Style vs Safety**: SC2155 is a style recommendation, not a bug
2. **Strict Default**: Shellcheck exits 1 for any warning by default
3. **Large Scripts**: Complex scripts naturally have unused variables or combined declarations
4. **CI Blocking**: Quality gate treats warnings as failures

**Solution**:
```bash
# Use --severity=error to only fail on actual problems
shellcheck --severity=error -f quiet "$script"

# Alternative: disable specific checks if needed
# shellcheck disable=SC2155,SC2034
```

**Prevention**:
- Use `--severity=error` in CI quality gates
- Reserve warnings for local development
- Document which checks are enforced in AGENTS.md
- Don't let style issues block functional code

**Tags**: #shellcheck #ci #static-analysis #warnings #quality-gate

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/quality_gate.sh` - Add --severity=error flag

---

### LESSON-015: GitHub API 403 Errors in Generic Templates

**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Component**: CI/CD / GitHub API / Token Permissions
**Severity**: High

**Issue**: CI job fails with "HTTP 403: Resource not accessible by integration" when calling GitHub API.

**Symptoms**:
- `gh label create` or similar commands fail with 403
- Job fails even with `GITHUB_TOKEN` set
- Works locally with personal access token
- Fails in pull requests from forks

**Root Cause**:
1. **Default Token Permissions**: `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` has read-only by default for security
2. **Missing Permissions Key**: Workflow didn't explicitly request `issues: write` permission
3. **Operation Requirements**: Creating labels via API requires `issues: write` permission (not just `pull-requests: write`)

**Solution** (Verified Working):
```yaml
# Add explicit permissions at job level
jobs:
  labels:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write    # Required for creating labels
    steps:
      - run: gh label create "bug" --color d73a4a
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Alternative Approaches**:
- Use Personal Access Token (PAT) with full repo scope (less secure)
- Use GitHub App token (most secure for orgs)
- Pre-create labels manually (simplest for static sets)

**Prevention**:
- Always check GitHub API permission requirements for operations
- Use `permissions:` key to explicitly request needed scopes
- Reference official docs: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/labels
- Test workflows in PR before merging to main

**Tags**: #github-api #permissions #token #issues-write #ci

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/ci-and-labels.yml` - Add `permissions: issues: write`

**References**:
- GitHub Actions labeler shows exact permission requirements
- Community Discussion #60820 on 403 errors
- REST API docs: POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/labels requires issues:write
